The tools website provides a suite of apps built with R Shiny that run different functions of the NicheMapR microclimate and ectotherm models. They include simulations of the typical day of each month of the year, as well as hindcasters for the globe as well as more specific ones for Australia and the USA, and a forecasting tool for Australia that predicts microclimates and ectotherm activity over the next three days. You can use them to get an idea of what the <a href=\"https:\/\/mrke.github.io\/\">NicheMapR package<\/a> does, and there is capacity to save the R code generated by a particular simulation so you can take analyses further in R.
