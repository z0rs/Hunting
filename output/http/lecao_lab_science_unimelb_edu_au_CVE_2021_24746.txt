Advances in single-cell RNA sequencing <\/span><span class=\"s2\">(scRNA-seq) have enabled GRN inference at cellular resolution; however, most existing <\/span><span class=\"s2\">approaches rely on predefined clusters or cell states, implicitly assuming static regulatory <\/span><span class=\"s2\">programs and potentially missing subtle, dynamic variation in regulation across individual <\/span><span class=\"s2\">cells. To address these limitations, we introduce NeighbourNet (NNet), a method that <\/span>constructs cell-specific co-expression networks. NNet first applies principal component analysis <span class=\"s2\">to embed gene expression into a low-dimensional space, followed by local regression within <\/span>each cell\u2019s k-nearest neighbourhood (KNN) to quantify co-expression. This approach improves computational efficiency and stabilises co-expression estimates, mitigating challenges posed <span class=\"s2\">by small sample sizes in KNN regression and the inherent noise and sparsity of scRNA-seq <\/span><span class=\"s2\">data. Beyond co-expression, NNet supports scalable downstream analyses, including (i) <\/span><span class=\"s2\">clustering and aggregating cell-specific networks into meta-networks that capture primary <\/span><span class=\"s2\">co-expression patterns, and (ii) integrating prior knowledge to annotate co-expression and <\/span><span class=\"s3\">infer active signalling interactions at the individual cell level. All functional modules of NNet <\/span><span class=\"s1\">are implemented with an efficient algorithm that enables application to large-scale single-cell <\/span><span class=\"s2\">datasets. We demonstrate NNet\u2019s effectiveness through three case studies on transcription <\/span><span class=\"s3\">factor activity prediction, early haematopoiesis, and tumour microenvironments. Provided as <\/span><span class=\"s1\">an R package, NNet offers a novel framework for exploring cellular variation in co-expression <\/span>and integrates seamlessly with existing single-cell analysis workflows.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We introduce the latest work from our PhD student Yidi Deng (who has already secured a postdoc position at ANU!).

For ST with supercellular resolution, \u03a6-Space ST achieves interpretable cell type deconvolution with significantly faster computation. For subcellular resolution, \u03a6-Space ST annotates cell states without cell segmentation, leading to highly insightful spatial niche identification. \u03a6-Space ST harmonises annotations derived from multiple scRNA-seq references, and provides interpretable characterisations of disease cell states by leveraging healthy references. We validate \u03a6-Space ST in three case studies involving CosMx, Visium and Stereo-seq platforms for various cancer tissues. Our method revealed niche-specific enriched cell types and distinct cell type co-presence patterns that distinguish tumour from non-tumour tissue regions. These findings highlight the potential of \u03a6-Space ST as a robust and scalable tool for ST data analysis for understanding complex tissues and pathologies.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Dr Jiadong Mao has worked on an extension of his previous method \u03a6-Space for spatial transcriptomics studies!

Effective analysis of these data requires careful preprocessing, modeling, and interpretation to detect subtle signals and avoid spurious associations. In this review, we discuss how simulation can serve as a sandbox to test candidate approaches, creating a setting that mimics real data while providing ground truth. This is particularly valuable for power analysis, methods benchmarking, and reliability analysis. We explain the probability, multivariate analysis, and regression concepts behind modern simulators and how different implementations make trade-offs between generality, faithfulness, and controllability.

Seawater microbes (bacteria and archaea) play essential roles in coral reefs by facilitating nutrient cycling, energy transfer, and overall reef ecosystem functioning. However, environmental disturbances such as degraded water quality and marine heatwaves, can impact these vital functions as seawater microbial communities experience notable shifts in composition and function when exposed to stressors. This sensitivity highlights the potential of seawater microbes to be used as indicators of reef health. Microbial indicator analysis has centred around measuring the taxonomic composition of seawater microbial communities, but this can obscure heterogeneity of gene content between taxonomically similar microbes, and thus microbial functional genes have been hypothesised to have more scope for predictive potential, though empirical validation for this hypothesis is still pending. Here, we establish a functional baseline of seawater microbiomes across outer Great Barrier Reef (GBR) sites to compare the diagnostic value between taxonomic and functional information in inferring continuous physico-chemical metrics in the surrounding reef.<\/p>\n<p>Results. Integrating gene-centric analyses with 17 physico-chemical variables (temperature, salinity, and particulate and dissolved nutrients) across 48 reefs revealed that associations between microbial functions and environmental parameters were twice as stable compared to taxonomy-environment associations. Distinct seasonal variations in surface water chemistry were observed, with nutrient concentrations up to 3-fold higher during austral summer explained by enhanced production of particulate organic matter (POM) primarily by Synechococcus , whereas in winter, nutrient levels were lower and POM production was also attributed to Pr ochlor ococcus . Additionally, heterotrophic microbes (e.g., Rhodospirillaceae , Burkholderiaceae , Fla v obacteriaceae , and Rhodobacter aceae ) were enriched in reefs with elevated dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and phytoplankton-derived POM, encoding functional genes related to membrane transport, sugar utilisation, and energy metabolism. These microbes likely contribute to the coral reef microbial loop by capturing and recycling nutrients derived from Synechococcus and Pr ochlor ococcus , ultimately transferring nutrients from picocyanobacterial primary producers to higher trophic levels.<\/p>\n<p>Conclusion. This study reveals that functional information in reef-associated seawater microbes robustly associates with physico-chemical variables than taxonomic data, highlighting the importance of incorporating microbial function in reef monitoring initiatives. Our integrative approach to mine for stable seawater microbial biomarkers can be expanded to include additional continuous metrics of reef health (e.g., benthic cover of corals and macroalgae,<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> \u00a0<\/span>scale reef metagenomics datasets beyond the GBR.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>PhD candidate Marko Terzin from James Cook University and the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) has spent a few months in 2023 in our lab &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2945,"featured_media":662,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[338405,58],"tags":[338385,338409,338410,338408],"class_list":["post-661","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-microbiome","category-events","tag-manuscript","tag-metagenomics","tag-mint","tag-pls-methods"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/lecao-lab.science.unimelb.edu.au\/files\/2025\/01\/Screenshot-2025-01-02-at-12.07.40\u202fpm.png","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/lecao-lab.science.unimelb.edu.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/661","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/lecao-lab.science.unimelb.edu.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/lecao-lab.science.unimelb.edu.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/lecao-lab.science.unimelb.edu.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2945"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/lecao-lab.science.unimelb.edu.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=661"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/lecao-lab.science.unimelb.edu.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/661\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":664,"href":"https:\/\/lecao-lab.science.unimelb.edu.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/661\/revisions\/664"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/lecao-lab.science.unimelb.edu.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/662"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/lecao-lab.science.unimelb.edu.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=661"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/lecao-lab.science.unimelb.edu.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=661"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/lecao-lab.science.unimelb.edu.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=661"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":656,"date":"2025-01-02T11:49:18","date_gmt":"2025-01-02T00:49:18","guid":{"rendered":"https:\/\/blogs.unimelb.edu.au\/lecao-lab\/?p=656"},"modified":"2025-01-02T11:49:18","modified_gmt":"2025-01-02T00:49:18","slug":"global-picoplankton-biogeography-revealed-by-metagenomic-and-climatic-data-integration","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/lecao-lab.science.unimelb.edu.au\/2025\/01\/02\/global-picoplankton-biogeography-revealed-by-metagenomic-and-climatic-data-integration\/","title":{"rendered":"Global picoplankton biogeography revealed by metagenomic and climatic data integration"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Vini Salazar is reaching the end of his PhD candidature (and has already secured a continuing position at Melbourne Bioinformatics, UoM \ud83c\udf89).

Picoplankton are the smallest and most abundant planktonic organisms. The distribution and ecology of these organisms is determined by environmental factors and their biogeography is largely shaped by basin-scale patterns of physicochemical composition of ocean waters. The increased availability of high-throughput sequencing data of microbial communities has enabled the description of how the global oceans are partitioned into distinct microbial biogeographical provinces. However, the key attributes associated with such provinces are still unclear. Here we present a model of picoplankton biogeography based on 1454 metagenomes from multiple sampling consortia, resulting in the largest integrated surface ocean metagenome analysis to date. We identify ten distinct groups based on metagenomic dissimilarity, divided into three categories: polar (Arctic and Antarctic), temperate (coastal temperate, temperate\/subtropical transition, oceanic temperate, Mediterranean-like) and tropical (tropical low nutrient, tropical high nutrient, subtropical oceanic gyres). Using machine learning and omics data integration techniques, we predict province areas across the surface oceans and describe their environmental, taxonomical, and functional features. We quantify the relationship between environmental factors and each biogeographical province, identify their main representative taxa and the importance of carbon degradation and antimicrobial resistance pathways in functional community composition, and discuss implications for establishing a model for global picoplankton biogeography.<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Vini Salazar is reaching the end of his PhD candidature (and has already secured a continuing position at Melbourne Bioinformatics, UoM \ud83c\udf89).

The microbiome is a complex ecosystem of interdependent taxa that has traditionally been studied through cross-sectional studies. However, longitudinal microbiome studies are becoming increasingly popular. These studies enable researchers to infer taxa associations towards the understanding of coexistence, competition, and collaboration between microbes across time. Traditional metrics for association analysis, such as correlation, are limited due to the data characteristics of microbiome data (sparse, compositional, multivariate). Several network inference methods have been proposed, but have been largely unexplored in a longitudinal setting.<\/p>\n<p id=\"p-4\">We introduce LUPINE (LongitUdinal modelling with Partial least squares regression for NEtwork inference), a novel approach that leverages on conditional independence and low-dimensional data representation. This method is specifically designed to handle scenarios with small sample sizes and small number of time points. LUPINE is the first method of its kind to infer microbial networks across time, while considering information from all past time points. We validate LUPINE and its variant, LUPINE_single (for single time point anlaysis) in simulated data and three case studies, where we highlight LUPINE\u2019s ability to identify relevant taxa in each study context, across different experimental designs (mouse and human studies, with or without interventions, as short or long time courses). To detect changes in the networks across time, groups or in response to external disturbances, we used different metrics to compare the inferred networks.<\/p>\n<p id=\"p-5\">LUPINE is a simple yet innovative network inference methodology that is suitable for, but not limited to, analysing longitudinal microbiome data. The R code and data are publicly available for readers interested in applying these new methods to their studies.<\/p>\n<p><strong>FAQ<\/strong>:<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Q: <\/strong>Do you build up the network from the covariance matrix or from the inverse covariance matrix? And what are you doing linear regression on?<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>A: <\/strong>The network is built on the partial correlation so it would be similar to the inverse covariance matrix. But instead of estimating the inverse covariance matrix, we calculate partial correlations through linear regression. To estimate the partial correlation between taxa <em>a<\/em> and taxa <em>b, <\/em>we\u00a0regress their counts on the low dimensional representation of other taxa (excluding taxa <em>a<\/em> and <em>b<\/em>). This is then repeated for all pairs (we have an efficient way to do this computationally).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Q: <\/strong>You&#8217;ve got the correlation structure between the taxa which you are trying to build up and you have also got the longitudinal correlation structure that you build into your simulation. How does that affect your computation of covariances?<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>A: <\/strong>We do not take the longitudinal correlation between into account at all in LUPINE, but this is something we are considering for our future research.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Q: <\/strong>You reduce the dimension of the data into one dimension. How much variance can be explained by the 1st component in your computation?<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>A: <\/strong>It depends on the data, but in the data we analysed, and if consider the single time point scheme only with PCA, the first component explained about 25% of the total variance. We could add more components into the regression but that may overfit the regression model. This is why we only select the first component, which explains much of the variance (for PCA, single time point) or covariance (for PLS, multiple time points).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Q: <\/strong>Do you think that this approach would work on single cell data trying to look at gene co expression in sort of longitudinal data in across time points?<\/p>\n<p><strong>A: <\/strong>It will not work with the present single cell technologies, because in LUPINE we need the same individuals\/samples\/cells across time to infer the association.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Q: <\/strong>When you do the linear regression, do you regress directly on the counts with all the zeros and the sparsity that you mentioned?<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>A: <\/strong>Yes, the method was originally developed for count data. We regress on the count data, but we also include library size as an offset to account for different library sizes. The method also works with center log ratio values, which I used to analyse the third case study.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Q: <\/strong>Do you apply your method for the two groups combined or separately?<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>A: <\/strong>I model each group separately as we assume that each group has a unique network.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Q: <\/strong>You&#8217;re building the networks building based on the partial correlations. What about the actual network for representation, do you actually binarize it?<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>A: <\/strong>Yes, I binarize the network based on a correlation test.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Dr Saritha Kodikara has developed a PLS-based to infer microbial networks across time!
